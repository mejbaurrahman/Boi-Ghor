# Boi Ghor

Boi Ghor is a React-based website designed for book enthusiasts. It offers a clean and responsive UI with multiple sections like a book listing, detailed book pages, and a basic FAQ. The website also handles invalid routes with a custom 404 Not Found page.

## Features

- **Navbar**:
  - Menu items include Home, About, Blog, FAQ, Buy Book, and Sign In.
  - Currently, About, Blog, Buy Book, and Sign In are non-functional placeholders.
- **Banner**:
  - Displayed below the navbar, it can be used for promotional content or announcements.
- **Book Available Section**:

  - Shows a collection of books using book cards. Each card has a "Book Details" button that navigates to a detailed book page via React Router.

- **Book Details Page**:

  - Includes two buttons: "Wish to Read" and "Add to Cart."
  - Both buttons trigger a SweetAlert2 confirmation prompt when clicked.

- **FAQ Section**:

  - Contains basic React-related questions and answers displayed using an accordion UI component.
